  English Explorers
 </h1>
   <h2>
While Portugal and Spain had been sponsoring expeditions as early as the 15th century, England showed little interest in exploration until the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. In the Elizabethan era, England emerged as a frontrunner in the European race for riches and territory in the Americas. By the early 1600s, it had become one of the most powerful sea-faring nations in the world.   </h2>

            <h1>Sir Walter Raleigh</h1>
         <p> <b>Sir Walter Raleigh</b> was an <b>English explorer</b> and <b>privateer</b> known for his explorations in the Americas. He rose to prominence as a young man when he captured the attention of <b>Queen Elizabeth I</b>. He became a favorite of the Queen quickly and served as captain of her guard for years. Their relationship became rocky when the Queen found out about his secret marriage to another woman.  </p>
         <p> After Raleigh fell out of favor with the Queen, he explored other interests. He was a supporter of English colonization in North America and invested in many expeditions. He came close to establishing a permanent settlement at <b>Roanoke</b>, but after a series of setbacks, it ultimately failed.  </p>    
         <p> Later, he led an expedition to <b>El Dorado</b>. He didn’t find the rumored riches, but the mission brought him back into the good graces of the Queen. However, the Queen’s reign was soon to be over and <b>King James I</b>, her successor, was not tolerant of Raleigh’s methods. By the end of his life, Raleigh had a tarnished reputation and few allies. In 1618, he was executed at <b>Westminster</b> by the order of the King.  </p>

            <h1>Henry Hudson</h1>
<p><b>Henry Hudson</b> was an <b>English explorer</b> of <b>North America</b> and the <b>Arctic</b> who looked for a northern route to Asia both eastward and westward. His dangerous voyages were unsuccessful in this aim, but they did lead him and his crew to territory previously uncharted by Europeans and provided information about the geography of North America.   </p?
         <p>Two major bodies of water are named after Hudson: the <b>Hudson River</b> and the </b>Hudson Bay</b>. He found the Hudson Bay on his final voyage.  </p>
