  English Explorers
 </h1>
   <h2>
While Portugal and Spain were sponsoring expeditions as the 15th century, England showed little interest in exploration until the reign of Queen Elizabeth 1. By the early 17th century, England had become one of the most powerful sea-faring nations in the world.

            <h1>Sir Walter Raleigh</h1>
            <p> Sir Walter Raleigh was an English explorer and privateer. He rose to prominence with the help of Queen Elizabeth I, who was very fond of him. He supported English colonization of North America, and invested in many expeditions hoping to establish a permanent colony. Off the coast of present-day North Carolina, he attempted to establish the failed colony of Roanoke. </p>
         <p> Later in his career, Raleigh was less successful and saw less support from the Crown. After fell out of favor with the Queen, he led an expedition to El Dorado, the rumored city of gold. While he didn't get the riches he sought from the expedition, he did succeed in getting back into the good graces of the Queen. However, the Queen's time was soon to be over and King James I, the Queen's successor, was not tolerant of Raleigh's methods. By the end of his life, Raleigh had a tarnished reputation and few allies. In 1618, he was executed at Westminster by the order of the King. </p>
